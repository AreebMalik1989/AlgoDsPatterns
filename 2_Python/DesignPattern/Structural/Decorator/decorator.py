"""
Decorator design pattern implementation

Intent:

    Decorator is a structural design pattern that lets you attach new behaviors
    to objects by placing these objects inside special wrapper objects that
    contain the behaviors.

Implementation:

1.  Component: declares the common interface for both wrappers and wrapped
    objects.

2.  Concrete Component: is a class of objects being wrapped. It defines the
    basic behavior, which can be altered by decorators.

3.  Base Decorator class: has a field for referencing a wrapped object. The
    fieldâ€™s type should be declared as the component interface so it can
    contain both concrete components and decorators. The base decorator
    delegates all operations to the wrapped object.

4.  Concrete Decorators: define extra behaviors that can be added to components
    dynamically. Concrete decorators override methods of the base decorator and
    execute their behavior either before or after calling the parent method.

5.  The Client can wrap components in multiple layers of decorators, as long as
    it works with all objects via the component interface.
